# Geolocation Plugin Demo

This repository contains a simple project which demonstrates how to use the `cordova-plugin-geolocation` plugin with Monaca.

The project shows how to get the user's location one time, and also watch it for changes. It also demonstrates how to use this information to display the location on a map, and calculate the distance from other places.

The project has been tested with version 2.4.3 of the plugin on the following devices:

 - iPhone X (iOS 11.1.1)
 - Nexus 5X (Android 8.0)
 - Galaxy S4 (Android 4.4.2)
